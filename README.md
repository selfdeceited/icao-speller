This is where I tell you why ICAO Speller exists

### What is it for? ###

ICAO Speller is made to spell usual words, links, names, captions and terms using NATO (and ICAO) phonetic alphabet. Pilots use it to spell correctly via radio connection to make the meaning of the words definite and to prevent "broken phone" effect.

You can see how usual text can be spelled in Russian and English transaltions of ICAO alphabet. Also you can see your text written in Morse code.
